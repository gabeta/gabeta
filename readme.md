# 👋🏽 Yé Fotamana, Akwaba, Hello, Dan sé

I am Gabeta Songoudaha Soro, I am a Senufo from the Ivory Coast and proud. I am passionate about my culture and new technologies. My life comes down to writing code, listening to [boloye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88jfUFRadBQ) and watching the [WAMBELE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAyA1yB6pCw). My wildest dream is to lead a sabbatical life in the Senufo country.


--- In the meantime I try to contribute enough money to buy a camera, to go photograph DIBY the black fetish in my father village in NIOFOUIN. ---


### ☕️ Buy me a coffee
